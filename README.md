# Audio Echo Processor
An Audio Processing application designed to implement echo effects on PCM audio data. The application reads audio samples stored in flash memory, applies an echo effect, and writes the processed audio back to flash for playback. The audio data is handled in 16-bit signed PCM format, sampled at 16 kHz.
